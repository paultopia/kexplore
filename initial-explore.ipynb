Agora will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with prompt notification of any claim for which Agora seeks an indemnity, but Agora’ failure to provide such prompt notice will not limit your obligation to indemnify Agora unless you have been materially harmed by such failure of prompt notice. Agora will cooperate in your defense of any claim, at your sole expense. You may not settle any claim against Agora in a manner that adversely affects Agora without Agora’ prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Agora may participate in the defense of a claim through counsel of its own choice at its own expense; provided, however, that if Agora reasonably determines that you are unwilling or unable to defend the interests of Agora, then Agora may assume the defense against any claims at your expense.

      "Severability, Waiver, and Interpretation. If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render the Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and, in such event, such provision is to be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law. No waiver of any breach of the Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other breach. In construing or interpreting the terms of the Agreement: (a) the headings in the Agreement are for convenience only, and are not to be considered, and (b) no presumption is to operate in either party’s favor as a result of its counsel’s role in drafting the Agreement.\n",

      "2.3\tAfter registration, we explain to you via email the most important basic functions of the community, and point out new features or content. You can also disable this help and news feature email at any time from your user account or by selecting the unsubscribe link in each email, which will disable any future notification. This can be reactivated again if necessary.\n",
      "3.  Rights and duties of the user\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1\tThe data required for registration must be provided truthfully and updated immediately if it changes to ensure smooth use. If alternative methods with access to existing user profiles (e.g., registration via Facebook) are offered for registration, this obligation applies accordingly to the data stored in those user profiles.\n",
      "3.2\tYou are responsible for protecting your registration and access data (e.g., user name, password) and you should not disclose them or tolerate or enable unauthorized or third parties to find them out. You are obliged to take the required measures to guarantee confidentiality and immediately report abuse or loss of such information or suspicions thereof to AJNS by e-mail to hello@kitchenstories.de.\n",
      "3.3\tAs part of the community functions you have the option to set up your own content in your profile (e.g., personal information, profile picture) and the database of Kitchen Stories content (e.g., personal recipes and videos). Please keep in mind that all registered users can view your profile. With respect to your own recipes you can decide yourself whether this content is visible to all the registered users of the App/Services or only to you.\n",
      "3.4\tYou are not allowed to add content that violates applicable laws or copyrights or personality rights of third parties or that could significantly disrupt the open and friendly environment in the community. In particular, you are not allowed to add any content that is abusive, defamatory, obscene, sexist, pornographic, political or extremist religious, violent, harmful to minors or otherwise illegal or unsuitable for an unrestricted circle of users. In addition, you may only add content that you have either created yourself or received permission to use from the author or any other disclosed people. You may not take content from other platforms or other sources without request and add it to the community under any circumstances.\n",
      "3.5\tDue to the large scope of user-generated content AJNS is not able to check all content before approving it, but it reserves the right to block, change, or delete content in reaction to complaints or upon obtaining knowledge in another way, if such content violates the principles mentioned in Section 3.4 or is not suitable for the subject of the community.\n",
      "4.  Rights and duties of the AJNS\n",
      "\n",
      "4.1\tAJNS provides the App for download through the App Stores.\n",
      "4.2\tAJNS provides the community functions for the App and the Services with the average availability rate of 97% a year. The availability calculation does not include the planned maintenance times within reasonable scope. AJNS will make an effort, within an economically viable scope, to inform about the planned maintenance times in a suitable location on the community platform ahead of time and to perform such maintenance work outside of the community peak times.\n",
      "4.3\tClarification: AJNS can change the content available through the App and/or the Services at its own discretion at any time. In particular, the content set up in the community could be changed or deleted by the authors. There is no entitlement to first-time or continued access to specific content.\n",
      "5.  Rights granted to the user\n",
      "\n",
      "5.1\tAJNS grants the user a world-wide, non-exclusive (simple), non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the App, the Services, and the content of the community including any documents and user manuals found in the App for private purposes and save and display within the scope necessary for use in accordance with regulations and contract, and share exclusively by using the App functions intended for this purpose with other users in the community or through other supported social networks. This right is permanent for the App and AJNS's own content and time-limited for the community for the period of the contract for the use of community functions. The user may download and use the App exclusively on devices that are linked to the App Store ID used for the installation. All rights that are not expressly granted, especially the right to process, disseminate and/or otherwise exploit the App and the community content remain reserved.\n",
      "5.2\tThe user may not decompile the App or otherwise reverse engineer it or try to find out the source code. An exception to this are actions that are necessary to obtain interface information required to ensure interoperability of the App with third-party software; this requires that the user has previously made unsuccessful attempts to find out such information from AJNS in exchange for an appropriate compensation of expenditures. Interface information obtained in this manner may only be used for establishing interoperability, and may not be published, and may only be provided to third parties in the scope necessary for establishing such interoperability.\n",
      "6.  Rights granted to AJNS; exemption\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1\tThe user grants to AJNS the gratuitous, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable right, limited to the duration of the contract, to save all community content added by users (including permitted derivative works such as translations) for the purposes of the contract for the use of the App, the Services, and the community functions, in particular including the display content with other users of the Community, and to duplicate, make publicly accessible, translate into other languages, and edit technically to the necessary extent, especially due to compatibility and optimization of the need for storage space and transfer capacities (in particular to compress and slightly reduce, even if the effects are visible; but the content cannot be distorted), and use in other ways as needed for the purposes of the contract. Important: AJNS does not appropriate the user's content.\n",
      "6.2\tYou commit to exempt AJNS from all damages, claims, costs (including customary legal fees) and expenditures that AJNS incurs as a result of in-court or out-of-court legal actions taken by third parties or authorities against AJNS due to or in connection with a breach of Section 3.4 of these Terms of Use in the community content added by you. This does not apply if you are not the one responsible for the breach.\n",
      "7.  Guarantee/Liability\n",
      "\n",
      "7.1\tThe App is provided free of charge and other services (specifically the Services) are also provided free of charge. AJNS does not assume any guarantees and is liable in accordance with the legal provisions only for intent and gross negligence; AJNS is only liable for App defects if AJNS maliciously concealed the defect.\n",
      "7.2\tIf parts of the App and/or specific services of AJNS are not free of charge through in-App purchases, AJNS is liable exclusively in accordance with the special terms for in-App purchases.\n",
      "7.3\tThe user must regularly back-up his/her data. If AJNS is liable for data loss in accordance with this section, such liability is limited to the restoration costs, which would have been incurred in case of regular and risk-adequate preparation of back-up copies.\n",
      "7.4\tAJNS is not liable for damages resulting from a change of the App by the user or a software and hardware environment that differs from system requirements.\n",
      "8.  Duration and cancellation; consequences of cancellation\n",
      "\n",
      "8.1\tClarification: The App itself is made available for permanent use; the corresponding right of use cannot be canceled.\n",
      "8.2\tThe contract for the use of the underlying community functions and the Services is concluded for an undetermined period of time and may be canceled regularly by either party at any time with a notice period of 7 days, unless otherwise specified in this section 8.\n",
      "8.3\tIn deviation from Section 8.2 the special conditions for any time-limited premium functions acquired through in-App purchases may specify other periods for regular cancellation of the contract for the use of the underlying community functions; unless special regulations are contained therein, the cancellation will become valid only once the contract period of the time-limited premium function ends.\n",
      "8.4\tThe legal right of both parties to an immediate extraordinary cancellation for an important reason remains reserved. An important reason for AJNS, in particular, is when the user breaches one of its obligations from Section 3 and, if the breach can be rectified, does not do so within 14 days after being prompted by AJNS to do so. In particular in case of breaches against Section 3.4 a notice period is superfluous.\n",
      "8.5\tAfter the cancellation of the use of community functions goes into effect, AJNS will no longer show the community content of the user and delete it after four weeks. Within this period, AJNS will provide the content to the user for download or in another reasonable manner on request.\n",
      "9.  Final provisions\n",
      "\n",
      "9.1\tChoice of law\n",
      "These Terms of Use are subject exclusively to the laws of Germany, excluding the CISG.\n",
      "9.2\tLanguage; contract text\n",
      "The contract is concluded in German and English. AJNS does not save the contract text. The Terms and Conditions can be viewed at any time on our website at impressum.kitchenstories.de\n",
      "9.3\tPlace of jurisdiction\n",
      "The place of jurisdiction and performance is Berlin for (i) users who are not consumers, (ii) users who have no residence in Germany upon contract conclusion or move to another country after contract conclusion, and (iii) users whose regular place of residence is unknown at the moment when a lawsuit is filed. Otherwise, the place of jurisdiction for consumers is based on the general rules.\n",
      "9.4\tSalvatory clause\n",
      "If a provision of this contract is or becomes invalid, the validity of the rest of this contract will not be affected. The parties agree, within reason and in good faith, to replace the invalid provision by a permissible regulation that is equivalent in terms of economic outcome, as long as this does not result in any substantial changes of the contractual content.\n",
      "9.5\tChanges to the Terms and Conditions\n",
      "AJNS may change and adapt these Terms during the validity period of the contract for the use of community functions effective for the future, if this is necessitated by changes in the legal and economic general conditions, especially changes in the law and court practices. AJNS will send the amended Terms to the user at least six weeks before the planned entry into effect per e-mail and point out especially the new provision. At the same time, AJNS will set a reasonable period of at least six weeks for the user to declare the acceptance of the amended Terms of Use for the further use of services. If no declaration of acceptance is made within this period, since the receipt of the information, the amended Terms will be considered accepted. AJNS will inform the customers once the period begins in particular of the legal consequence, i.e., the right to object, the deadline for objection, and the significance of remaining silent. This change mechanism does not apply to changes of the parties' main contractual duties.\n",

      "PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND Random Conversations TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and Random Conversations agree that all claims and disputes, including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Random Conversations are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: The phrase “all claims and disputes” includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.\n",
      "Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n",
      "Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\n",
      "Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with Random Conversations, you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because Random Conversations will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, Random Conversations will pay that forum’s fees as well.\n",
      "Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Random Conversations The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Random Conversations\n",
      "Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Random Conversations WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Random Conversations are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Random Conversations over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND Random Conversations WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n",
      "Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.\n",
      "Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.\n",
      "Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Random Conversations can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Random Conversations in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Random Conversations username and the email address you used to set up your Random Conversations account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.\n",
      "Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Random Conversations may bring an individual action in small claims court.\n",

You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the site or these terms must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall be forever barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. If any provision contained in these terms is determined unenforceable, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of these terms shall be effective except pursuant to a written instrument signed by us expressly waiving compliance, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated in such writing.

Billing charges will be processed immediately when your order is taken and according to the billing details displayed, as well as when your subscription is automatically renewed.

If you have not reached that age, you hereby represent and warrant that you have the permission or authority of your parent or guardian to register your User Information with the Application. We take our responsibility to our younger users seriously. Children under the age of 13 and their parents should review the section of this policy called “Children’s Privacy” which discusses the special steps that we take for children who may visit our pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Children’s Privacy. These terms and conditions apply to children as well as adults. There are some extra precautions that we take, however, with respect to collecting information from children under the age of 13. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires us to inform the parents (or legal guardians) of children under the age of 13 about our collection, use and disclosure practices regarding the personally-identifiable information of their children who are under the age of 13, and to obtain their consent before their child is permitted to use certain features of our Application. All subscribers will be requested to provide their age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 online without first obtaining permission from a child’s parent or guardian. When children under 13 years of age attempt to subscribe to the Application, we send their parent or guardian an e-mail to get their permission to collect the child’s personally identifiable information as part of their registration. If we do not receive permission within 14 days, we will delete the request and the child will not be able to complete his or her registration. Once a parent or guardian gives permission for its child to register, the parent will be asked to complete the child’s mailing information on behalf of the child.  When complete, the child will be able to subscribe to the Application without any further requests of consent to the parent; however, the parent will be notified when the child enters any additional information.  Should the child’s personally identifiable information require updating, the parent would be required to make any and all updates to its child’s registration information on behalf of the child. We do not require a child to provide more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity. (You may wish to be aware that, according to the FTC, website operators are not permitted to collect more information than is needed for a child to participate in an online activity.) Our Application does not offer activities that allow the child to disclose his or her personal information publicly (for example through chat rooms or message boards). Assuming that we have received any requisite parental consent, we may use information collected from a child under 13, for example, to provide and enable the child to participate in activities that may be available on the Application, to allow the child to obtain services or products requested, to send updates regarding our Application, services or products, to send announcements, to conduct internal market research activities, and to otherwise promote our activities and products. We do not share children’s personally identifiable information with third parties. Please visit www.ftc.gov for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children’s privacy online and COPPA.\n",

      "15. Indemnity. You agree to indemnify and hold us, XQ Creative, LLC, the Application, our owners, and our related entities, including without limitation Odio, Inc., employees, officers, directors, agents, shareholders, partners and affiliates harmless from any and all claims and demands (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) made by any third party due to or arising from any questions, comments, letters, messages, images, videos, GIFs created by you, or requests that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Application, breach of the representations and warranties above, use of the Application and the information provided on it, violation of the terms of this policy, and/or your violation of any rights of another.\n",

      "17. Termination or Suspension of Your Account.

YOU AND WIKIREALTY AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration. \n",
      "\n",
      "Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to WikiRealty, to you via any other method available to WikiRealty, including via e-mail. The Notice to WikiRealty should be addressed to WikiRealty, Inc., 1640 5th Street, Suite 216, Santa Monica, CA 90401, Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the “Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice must (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific relief sought (the “Demand”). If you and WikiRealty do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or WikiRealty may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at http://www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against WikiRealty, then WikiRealty will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon WikiRealty’s receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee. \n",
      "\n",
      "Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in Los Angeles, California shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and WikiRealty agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. \n",
      "\n",
      "No Class Actions. YOU AND WIKIREALTY AGREE THAT YOU AND WIKIREALTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID. \n",

      "Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in these Terms. \n",

      "Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which WikiRealty seeks equitable relief of any kind.

      "Claims. You and WikiRealty agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. \n",

      "Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against WikiRealty must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section.

      "\n",
      "Modifications. In the event that WikiRealty makes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration provision (other than a change to WikiRealty’s Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to WikiRealty’s Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with WikiRealty and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Dispute Resolution provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive the termination of these Terms. \n",

      "Enforceability.

      "Campanda enables the renter to conveniently search for and place online bookings for caravans and mobile homes available for hire (hereinafter referred to as the “Vehicles”) via the “Campanda” platform. However, Campanda does not offer any vehicles for hire itself. Its role is restricted to operating the platform and acting as an agent for the corresponding hire contracts concluded between the respective rental company and renter. The hire contracts are therefore concluded exclusively between the rental company and renter, for which the respective rental company’s separate terms of hire apply and which are displayed on the platform as part of the rental company’s particular offer. Each rental company is solely responsible for the offers made by it on the platform, for the content of such offers and for the conclusion and performance of the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Registration\n",
      "3.1 Registration is not required if the renter is simply visiting the platform and viewing the vehicles available for hire. However, if the renter would like to conclude a contract with a renter via the platform, he must register before doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Only renters who are of legal age, legally competent and hold an appropriate driver’s licence for driving mobile homes or caravans may register.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3 The personal data requested during the registration process is to be provided truthfully and completely. In particular, it is impermissible to provide information that belongs to third parties. The renter shall notify Campanda of any changes to the data without delay or shall change his data in the login area provided for this purpose on the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.4 By submitting the completed registration form, the renter thereby makes a binding offer to conclude a usage agreement with Campanda with regard to the platform’s services. Campanda thereupon sends the renter a confirmation e-mail containing his personal access data. This confirmation e-mail represents Campanda’s binding declaration of acceptance with respect to concluding the usage agreement. The usage agreement is concluded when the renter receives the confirmation e-mail. This does not affect Campanda’s right to reject individual renters as contractual partners without having to state any reasons. Both the confirmation e-mail and any renter rejection notice shall be sent within 5 working days of the renter registering on the platform. Detailed information about the registration process itself and how the renter can identify and correct input errors during registration can be found on the Campanda platform at www.campanda.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.5 Upon successful registration, Campanda creates an account for the renter, which he can access with his username and password (hereinafter referred to as the “Access Data”). The username is the e-mail address specified by the renter during the registration process. The renter chooses the password himself and can change it at any time in the password-protected login area of the platform. The renter undertakes to keep the access data secret and to protect it against access by unauthorised third parties. If the renter has lost the access data, or if he finds out or suspects that it is being used by a third party, he shall inform Campanda of this fact without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.6 Should these Terms of Use be infringed, especially due to - incorrect information being provided during registration, - unauthorised forwarding of the access data, especially the password, and/or - misuse of the platform, Campanda is entitled to temporarily block the renter’s access data and/or to extraordinarily terminate the usage agreement without notice. Following an incident such as this, the renter may not re-register without Campanda’s prior express consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Contract with Campanda, costs, term, termination\n",
      "4.1 The usage agreement concluded with Campanda following successful registration is free of charge to the renter. The renter is not obligated to conclude a hire contract. However, if he places a binding booking for a vehicle via the platform and thus concludes a hire contract with the relevant rental company, he shall pay Campanda a deposit pursuant to Paragraph 7.2 of these Terms of Use. However, this deposit applies solely to the hire contract concluded with the rental company – Campanda does not impose a separate agency commission on the renter for concluding the contract. The same applies to the cancellation fee imposed in the event of a cancellation (cf. Paragraph 8 of these Terms of Use).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 The contract is concluded for an indefinite period of time. Notwithstanding the right to extraordinary termination of the contract for cause pursuant to the statutory provisions, both parties can ordinarily terminate the contract with a notice period of 2 weeks to the end of the month without having to state any reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Cancellation right\n",
      "As a consumer, i.e. as a natural person, who concludes the contract with regard to the use of the Campanda platform for a purpose that can neither be attributed to their commercial nor their self-employed professional activity, the renter is entitled to a statutory cancellation right, for which Campanda has the following policy: Cancellation policy Cancellation right You may cancel your contractual declaration in writing (e.g. by letter, fax, e-mail) within 14 days without having to state any reasons. The period starts once the renter has received this policy in text form, but not before the contract is concluded and not before our information obligations pursuant to Article 246 § 2 in conjunction with § 1 Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Introductory Act to the German Civil Code and our obligations pursuant to § 312g Paragraph 1 Clause 1 of the German Civil Code in conjunction with Article 246 § 3 of the Introductory Act to the German Civil Code have been satisfied. Timely dispatch of the notice of cancellation is sufficient to comply with the cancellation period. The notice of cancellation is to be addressed to: Campanda GmbH Uhlandstraße 175 10719 Berlin, Germany Fax: +49 (0)30 8095 20 499 E-mail: info@campanda.com Consequences of cancellation In the event of an effective cancellation, both parties shall return any goods received and any benefits derived (e.g. interest). If the renter cannot return the goods received and benefits derived (e.g. benefits of use) to Campanda, or can do so, albeit only to a certain extent or in a deteriorated condition, he shall pay Campanda an appropriate amount of compensation. This can result in the renter nonetheless having to satisfy the contractual payment obligations for the period up until the cancellation. Payment reimbursement obligations must be fulfilled within 30 days. For the renter, the period starts when he sends his notice of cancellation; for Campanda, the period starts when it receives the notice of cancellation. Special notices The renter’s cancellation right expires prematurely if both parties have fully performed the contract at the renter’s explicit request before he exercised his cancellation right. End of the cancellation policy\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Contract with the Rental company, booking\n",
      "6.1 If the renter has decided in favour of a particular vehicle on the platform, he can select this and submit a binding offer to conclude a non-gratuitous hire contract with the relevant rental company by pressing the corresponding button at the end of the online booking process. The rental company accepts this offer by sending a binding declaration of acceptance by e-mail via Campanda, notwithstanding the right to reject a renter as a contractual partner without having to state any reasons. Detailed information about how the booking process works, how the renter can identify and correct input errors during booking and the contract concluded between the rental company and the renter can be found on the Campanda platform at www.campanda.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Accordingly, Campanda accepts bookings in the rental company’s name as his representative and conveys the declarations between the rental company and the renter.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Completing the booking, pre-payment by the Renter, Campanda security, cancellation fee\n",
      "7.1 When a booking is successfully completed via the Campanda platform, a hire contract under the agreed terms is concluded exclusively between the renter and the rental company.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.2 If the renter books the vehicle more than 30 days before the hire start date, he shall pay a deposit totalling 20% of the net hire price due upon making the booking via the platform. The remaining 80% of the net hire price becomes due for payment 30 days before the hire start date. If the booking is made only 30 days or less before the hire start date, the renter shall pay the full net hire price as a pre-payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.3 Campanda strives to provide maximum security for the renter when hiring the vehicle online. The deposits or pre-payments within the meaning of Paragraph 7.2 are therefore made to Campanda, who offers a guarantee that the renter’s deposits or pre-payments shall be reimbursed, if necessary, should a problem arise with the rental company (e.g. vehicle unavailability).\n",
      "\n",
      "7.4 A booking shall be deemed to be effective upon completion of the online booking process. The renter can print out the booking confirmation directly from the Campanda platform after completing the last step or he can download it separately as a PDF. Campanda shall send it to the renter by e-mail and SMS, if required, as part of a parallel process.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Changes to the booking, cancellation, cancellation fees\n",
      "8.1 The vehicle booking made on the Campanda platform is binding. If the renter wishes to change the booking details – the time period or number of people, for instance – after making the booking, he is advised to contact Campanda immediately either by phone or e-mail. Changes and cancellations should always be made via the Campanda booking system. Campanda then forwards the corresponding change requests to the rental company.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.2 Campanda indicates that any cancellations made by the renter that are not due to a circumstance for which he is not responsible can result in the rental company imposing lump-sum cancellation fees. The cancellation fees vary depending on how close the cancellation is made to the hire start date and can be found both in the Rental Company’s Terms of Hire and on the platform. However, Campanda does not impose a separate cancellation fee itself. The rental company can cancel his booking on the Campanda platform by pressing the “Cancel booking” button on the platform or by sending an e-mail to info@campanda.com. The renter shall receive a confirmation e-mail in the event of a cancellation.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Prices\n",
      "All of the hire prices quoted on the Campanda platform apply per vehicle, and – where appropriate – to the specified number of persons, their age (or status, “adult”, “child”, “baby”, etc.) and the specified number of free kilometres. The prices include VAT and ancillary costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Data privacy\n",
      "Campanda’s business philosophy includes handling personal data in a respectful and confidential manner. Campanda attaches a great deal of importance to complying with the data privacy provisions, especially those set forth in the Federal Data Protection Act and the German Teleservices Act. Please refer to Campanda’s data privacy provisions for details on data privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Newsletter\n",
      "11.1 Following separate registration, Campanda reserves the right to regularly send the renter newsletters and news about the Campanda platform by e-mail. The newsletter and news is presented in an editorial format and contains the latest information and notices about new functions or mobile homes and caravans available for hire on the Campanda platform. The renter can unsubscribe from the newsletter and news at any time by clicking on the links contained in the newsletter or by sending an e-mail to info@campanda.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "11.2 Campanda reserves the right to place third-party advertising on the platform (e.g. in the form of advertising banners). However, advertising such as this is commonplace on the Internet and is shown separately from the actual platform content.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Warranty, liability\n",
      "12.1 Campanda’s warranty for the services rendered in connection with operating the Campanda platform and the agency services is in accordance with the statutory provisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.2 According to the statutory provisions, Campanda shall assume liability for damages that the renter suffers due to intent, gross negligence or culpable infringement of material contractual obligations. “Material contractual obligations” shall be understood to mean contractual obligations, the fulfilment of which makes the due execution of the contract possible and upon compliance with which the renter may regularly rely, or the breach of which jeopardises the achievement of the objective of the contract. According to the statutory provisions, Campanda shall also assume liability for damages which are based on the absence of an assured property in connection with operating the Campanda platform, which are the consequences of an injury caused by Campanda to health, life or limb, or for which liability is required pursuant to the Product Liability Act. Liability shall be otherwise excluded, regardless of legal reason. In particular, Campanda shall not assume any liability for damages associated with data loss, insofar as the damages could have been avoided if the renter had performed a complete back-up of all of the relevant data on a regular basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Final provisions\n",
      "13.1 The exclusive language used to conclude the contract governing Campanda’s services is German. No separate wording is intended for the Campanda platform usage agreement. The content of the contract concluded between the renter and Campanda arises from these GTCs and the specific information provided during the registration process. If the renter registers, Campanda shall send him these GTCs and the other relevant information in a confirmation e-mail (cf. Paragraph 3.4). Campanda shall store the information; however the renter shall no longer be able to separately access this information over the Internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "13.2 The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply exclusively to the contract. The validity of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the German Private International Law is excluded. If the renter is a consumer, the mandatory consumer protection provisions valid in the country where the renter has his habitual place of residence shall apply, insofar as they grant the renter further protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "13.3 If the renter is a merchant, a legal person under public law or a public special fund, or has no general place of jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all claims and disputes arising from the contractual relationship is Berlin-Mitte.\n",

      "\n",
      "Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Service (“Dispute”), you and Yodas agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other. You will send your notice to 814 Montgomery St., San Francisco, CA 94133, ATTENTION: LEGAL DEPARTMENT. Yodas will send its notice by email to the email address provided by you in connection with your use of the Services.\n",

      "Binding Arbitration at Option of Either Party. If you and Yodas are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Yodas may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding arbitration. ANY ELECTION TO ARBITRATE BY ONE PARTY SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON THE OTHER. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court of proper jurisdiction rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Yodas will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted, at the option of the claimant, either in person or by video conference. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Yodas may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered and enforcement obtained thereon in any court having jurisdiction. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Each party shall have the right to participate by video conference in order to minimize travel and expense burdens. Subject to Article VII (Release and Indemnity), Article VIII (Limitation of Liability) and Article IX (Disclaimer of Warranties) of these Terms of Service, the arbitrator shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific performance.\n",

These Terms of Service and all aspects of the Services and Site shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the United States and the State of Delaware governing contracts entered into and to be fully performed in Delaware (i.e., without regard to conflict of laws provisions) regardless of your location except that Article XIV (Arbitration) of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the purpose of any judicial proceeding to enforce an arbitration award or incidental to such arbitration or to compel arbitration, or if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and Federal courts sitting in San Francisco County, California, and agree that service of process in such arbitration or court proceedings shall be satisfactorily made upon a party if sent by certified, express or registered mail addressed to it at the address you provided to Yodas whether through the Site or otherwise, or if no such address has been provided, by email to the email address provided by the relevant party to Yodas in connection with its use of the Services.

If Article XIII (Arbitration) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither you nor Yodas will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Article XIII (Arbitration) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Francisco County, California, and you and Yodas agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our Website is a travel search engine. KAYAK does not provide, own or control any of the travel services and products that you can access through Our Website, such as flights, accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the “Travel Products”). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Travel Providers”) either directly (e.g. airline) or as an agent (e.g. online travel agency). The Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel Products. The Travel Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking so you must agree to, and understand those terms. Further, the terms of the actual travel provider (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Travel Provider accessed through Our Website is at your own risk and KAYAK does not have any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during your travel.\n",

      "The display on Our Website of a Travel Product or Travel Provider does not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute a recommendation by KAYAK of that Travel Product or Travel Provider, or any sponsorship or approval of KAYAK by such Travel Provider, or any affiliation between such Travel Provider and KAYAK.\n",
      "\n",
      "KAYAK hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers. KAYAK is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since KAYAK has no control over the Travel Products and does not verify the content uploaded by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on Our Website. Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g. payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected. More details here. Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the display of the search results. Our currency conversion is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time; actual rates may vary and your payment provider (e.g. your credit card company) may charge conversion fees and apply another date’s currency rate.\n",

      "2. Booking through KAYAK\n",
      "\n",
      "If you make a booking through Our Website for Travel Products, that booking is made with the Travel Provider named on the booking page and Our Website only acts as a user interface. Accordingly KAYAK has no responsibility for the booking or the Travel Product because KAYAK has no involvement in creating the description of the Travel Product, in defining the price and any fees, and in providing the Travel Products that you book. If you have any issues or disputes around your booking and/or the Travel Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Travel Provider and not with us.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary: You agree to follow some basic rules when using Meetup’s Platform. These rules are described in these Terms of Service, including the related policies and guidelines discussed below. We may change these rules.\n",
      "1.1 The Agreement. Meetup enables you and other members to arrange off-line, real-world Meetup groups and Meetup events. The terms “Meetup,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include Meetup, Inc. and our affiliates. We use the terms “you” and “your” to mean any person using our Platform, and any organization or person using the Platform on an organization’s behalf. We use the word “Platform” to mean any website, application, or service offered by Meetup, including content we offer and electronic communications we send. We provide our Platform to you subject to these Terms of Service. We use the terms “Terms of Service” and “Agreement” interchangeably to mean this document together with our Usage and Content Policies, Group Policies, Organizer and Leadership Standards, Member Restrictions, Payment Policies, and Trademark Usage Guidelines. Your use of the Platform signifies that you agree to this Agreement. If you are using the Platform for an organization, you agree to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to the terms contained in this Agreement. If you do not or are unable to agree to this Agreement, do not use our Platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: We have included summaries and tips to provide an overview of some legal concepts and answer common questions, but the text of these summaries and tips are for your convenience only and are intended to have no legal effect.\n",

      "1.2 Revisions to this Agreement. We may modify this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this Agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.

      "\n",
      "2. Your Account and Membership\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: You need to be at least 18 years old to use our Platform. Meetup organizers control the Content and membership of their Meetup groups. However, we may remove any Content you post or terminate your account at any time.\n",
      "2.1 Eligibility. Our Platform is available to anyone who is at least 18 years old. You represent that you are at least 18. Additional eligibility requirements for a particular portion of our Platform may be set by any member who has the ability to moderate or manage that portion of our Platform. For example, the eligibility requirements for a Meetup group or Meetup event may be set by the organizers of that group.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Suspension of Your Account. We may modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest of the Meetup community, or to protect our brand or Platform. We also may remove accounts of members who are inactive for an extended period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A member who has the ability to moderate or manage a particular portion of our Platform also has the ability, in his or her sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate your access to that portion of the Platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Account Information and Security. When you register, you provide us with some basic information, including an email address and a password. Keep your email address and other account information current and accurate. Also, you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to disable your account). You alone are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. If someone is using your password, notify us immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fees, Payments, and Offers\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: We charge for certain features on our Platform. If you’re a Meetup group organizer, you’re responsible for paying for organizer subscription fees related to your Meetup group. These fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription), and may change in the future. Additionally, some organizers charge money for participation in a Meetup group or Meetup event.\n",
      "3.1 Fees Charged by Meetup. Use of some of the features on our Platform is free, and we charge fees for other features. We may in the future implement a new fee, or modify an existing fee, for certain current or future features of our Platform. If we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you advanced notice such as by posting changes on our Platform or sending you an email. You agree to pay those fees and any associated taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions are in U.S. dollars. All fees are exclusive of applicable federal, state, local, or other taxes. Organizer subscriptions are non-transferable.\n",
      "\n",
      " 3.2 Fees Charged by Organizers. Organizers may impose fees related to particular portions of the Platform, such as member dues for a Meetup group or an event fee for a Meetup event. The decision to charge fees and the amount of those fees is at the discretion of those organizers. We reserve the right to initiate refunds of fees paid to organizers, when appropriate, even in cases of fees paid through a third-party payment service. Refunds that we initiate, if any, will be governed by our Payment Policies. Organizers may also have their own refund policies, so long as they are consistent with and do not limit members’ ability to receive refunds under our Payment Policies. Payments made to organizers via the Platform are made through a third-party payment service provider. If a member pays a fee to an organizer via the Platform, the member authorizes the organizer (and the organizer’s applicable payment service provider) to charge the designated payment method for the total amount of the fees, including any applicable taxes and other charges. Certain types of fees charged by organizers may be billed on a recurring basis. If billed on a recurring basis, you authorize the organizer to charge the applicable fee to the designated payment method. You may cancel auto-renewal at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: You should use common sense in deciding whether to make a payment to any organizer. We cannot ensure that organizers will use payments as they promise or as you expect. You should check the refund policy of the Meetup group before making any payments to an organizer.\n",
      "3.3 Payments to Meetup. Organizers are responsible for paying subscription and any other applicable fees to Meetup on time and through our approved payment methods. Organizers who allow their organizer subscription to lapse are subject to removal as the organizer of the Meetup groups associated with their account, and their Meetup group (along with all of the information and Content associated with or posted to that Meetup group) may be terminated or transferred to another member. If we terminate, suspend, or remove your account in connection with violation of this Agreement, we are not obligated to refund any organizer subscription fees paid to Meetup. You may only pay organizer fees to Meetup using a valid payment method acceptable to us, as specified via the Platform. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Platform. You authorize us (and our designated third-party payment processors) to charge your designated payment method for the total amount of any fees you owe to Meetup, including any applicable taxes and other charges. If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise not acceptable to us, your payment may be suspended or cancelled. We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our payment processors to correct, any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been requested or received. We also may issue refunds, or instruct our payment processors to issue refunds, in accordance with our Payment Policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: To learn more about organizer subscriptions and what happens if they expire, see this FAQ on Expired Plans.\n",
      "3.4 Automatic Subscription Renewals. Fees for certain aspects of our Platform may be billed on either a recurring basis or on a one-time basis. If billed on a recurring basis, the fees are payable in advance of the applicable period specified via the Platform with no refunds. We will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation. By purchasing any feature or other aspect of our Platform for which we charge, you authorize us to keep your payment current by charging your credit card account (or any other means of payment used by you) the applicable fee. While you may cancel auto-renewal or cancel your subscription at any time, you won’t be issued a refund except in our sole discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: To cancel your organizer subscription, see this FAQ on Modifying Subscriptions.\n",
      "3.5 Free Trials. We may offer free trials of subscriptions and other products on our Platform. We will inform you of the length of the free trial, your renewal period, and the date and amount of your first payment. After your free trial ends, your paid subscription will begin and we will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation. You can cancel automatic subscription renewals at any time according to the terms and procedures described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.6 Third Party Payment Processors. An organizer that uses the Platform to accept payments from other members, must comply with the terms and conditions of the third party provider of the applicable payment service used to receive the payment. Meetup does not provide those payment services, is not a party to your agreement with the applicable third-party provider, and will not be liable or responsible for your use of those third-party payment services.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.7 Third Party Transactions. Your Meetup group or its members may receive offers from third parties, such as discounts, sponsorships, or other benefits. Meetup is not involved in any dealings or payments between you and third parties, and these Terms of Service do not govern such transactions.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Tip: Search engines can see public areas of the Platform. Your Content within these areas, such as the name and location that you provide during registration, and your membership in public Meetup groups, may appear in search results.

      "4.2 Content License from You. We do not claim ownership of your Content. However, to enable us to operate, improve, promote, and protect Meetup and our Platform, and to ensure we do not violate any rights you may have in your Content, you hereby grant Meetup a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license (including a waiver of any moral rights) to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, publish, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and create derivative works of, your Content and to commercialize and exploit the copyright, trademark, publicity, and database rights you have in your Content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: This license doesn’t give us ownership of any of your Content. It simply gives us and members the right to use it on or related to the Platform. This license continues even if you close your account, because it’s necessary for us to operate the Platform.\n",
      "4.3 Privacy. Meetup collects registration and other information about you through our Platform.

      "Summary: If you have a dispute with Meetup, you agree to try to work it out directly with us first.

Meetup has no obligation to get involved with any disputes you have with other members, although we may try to facilitate a resolution.\n",

      "\n",
      "9.4 Arbitration Procedures. Either party may commence arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party according to the notice procedures in Section 11.2. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and any other applicable rules that JAMS requires (“JAMS Rules”) in effect as of the demand for arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. Any arbitration hearings will take place in New York County, New York or elsewhere as required by JAMS Rules. Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and each other in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator from the appropriate JAMS list with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and contract disputes. The arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by JAMS Rules, can award costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party, except that the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.

Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at legal@figma.com, 142 Minna St. 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Figma with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Figma are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Figma otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.

The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.Arbitration Process\n",
      "A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration and a separate Demand for Arbitration for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.Arbitration Location and Procedure\n",
      "Unless you and Figma otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Figma submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.

Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Figma will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\n",

The AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a three, neutral arbitrators. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in Wilmington, Delaware, unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

      "The following terms and conditions shall apply to LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc.’s purchase from the seller (“Seller”) of the goods (the “Goods”) and the services (the “Services”), all as described on the Purchase Order attached hereto (the “Purchase Order”). All references to “Goods and Services” herein shall mean the Goods, the Services, or both the Goods and the Services. LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc., (“LGEUS”) will not accept nor be bound by and hereby expressly rejects any different or additional terms or conditions with respect to the Goods and/or the Services contained in any proposal, acknowledgement, invoice or other form or communication, other than those contained in a written agreement signed by both LGEUS and Seller covering the Goods and/or the Services. If there is no such written agreement, LGEUS will purchase the Goods and/or the Services only upon the following terms and conditions. Seller’s acknowledgement of the Purchase Order, shipment or delivery of the Goods or provision of the Services either in whole or in part shall constitute Seller's assent to and acceptance of the following terms and conditions.\n",
      "2. Taxes\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to the Purchase Order, these terms and conditions and the Goods and the Services, LGEUS shall be responsible only for taxes that LGEUS is required to pay under applicable statutes. All other taxes with respect to any of the same shall be paid by Seller. Seller shall separately state on all invoices and confirmations the applicable sales taxes imposed by Federal, State or local governments, unless an exemption is available.\n",

Supplier and the shippers selected by Seller shall comply with the safety and traffic regulations in force as communicated on respective shipping documentation. If any delivery is, or is threatened to be, delayed, Seller shall promptly give notice thereof to LGEUS’s authorized representative, together with all relevant information with respect thereto. The giving of and the terms of such notice shall not relieve Seller of any duty hereunder. Seller's failure to deliver the Goods and Services of the quality, within the time, at the place, at the rate and in the manner specified by the Purchase Order or agreed to by LGEUS in writing shall, at the option of LGEUS, without waiver of any right it has, relieve LGEUS of any obligation to accept and pay for such Goods or any undelivered installment thereof. In the event of any variance, all additional expenses to which LGEUS may be subjected as a result thereof shall be borne by and charged back to the Seller. Title to the Goods shall pass to LGEUS upon delivery of the Goods to LGEUS’s designated destination.\n",

Such changes must be pre-approved in writing and signed by an authorized representative of LGEUS.

Seller shall inspect all of the Goods prior to shipment. LGEUS may reject and/or return, at Seller’s expense, any Goods or Services found by LGEUS to be defective, non-conforming or not in compliance with the Purchase Order or these terms and conditions. Seller shall bear all risks after notice of rejection and shall be liable for all damages that are caused by such defective or non-conforming goods.

      "\n",
      "Seller acknowledges and accepts that non-compliance with said invoice submission requirement may result in a delay in payment. The price for the Goods and Services specified in the Purchase Order shall be Seller's lowest price currently in effect for the quantity of the Goods and Services involved, and shall not exceed current prices quoted or charged to any other customer of Seller for similar items and quantity. Should Seller quote, offer or provide any lower price or better terms for any of the Goods or Services of the same or less quantity to any other party prior to completion of the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Order, Seller shall promptly notify LGEUS, and, to the extent not unlawful, such lower price or better terms shall apply to the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Order. Time for calculation of LGEUS’s payment for the Goods and Services shall be computed from the date of LGEUS’s receipt of an acceptable invoice for same or LGEUS’s acceptance of the Goods or Services, whichever is later. Payment by LGEUS to Seller shall not constitute LGEUS’s acceptance of the Goods or Services. Seller's records shall be subject to audit by LGEUS, upon reasonable notice, at any time up to two years after payment of its final invoice; in the event of termination; other equitable adjustment; or with respect to any order for which the price is based on time and cost of materials. Upon discovery of any overpayment by LGEUS to Seller hereunder, Seller shall immediately return the full amount of such overpayment plus interest in the amount equal to two percent (2%) per month. The fees and expenses of LGEUS or its representatives performing an audit in accordance with this Section shall be borne by LGEUS. However, if an error in charges of more than three percent (3%) of the total amounts due under any billing period is discovered, then such fees and expenses shall be borne by Seller, and Seller shall promptly reimburse LGEUS for its audit expenses.\n",

Seller hereby further warrants, represents and covenants that the Goods and Services and all parts thereof and the operation thereof: shall (a) conform to the specifications, drawings, samples and descriptions attached hereto or referred to herein or in the Purchase Order, if any, or if the same are not provided, to LGEUS’s standard specifications; (b) conform to all applicable plans, drawings, samples or models furnished to and approved by LGEUS and conform to all of Seller's product literature and items referenced therein; (c) be in merchantable condition and free from all contaminants and defects in material, parts and workmanship and, to the extent not manufactured or provided according to detailed designs furnished by LGEUS to Seller, be free from all defects in design; (d) be fit for their intended purpose and for such particular uses specified by LGEUS or otherwise known by Seller; (e) be new and of established commercial operability and good quality; (f) not infringe any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property right; and (g) comply with all safety, health and environmental laws and regulations applicable thereto. With respect to any Services provided hereunder, Seller warrants that such Services shall be performed in accordance with the highest standards, practices and codes of the industry applicable to such Services. Seller's warranties contained herein (and any consumer warranties, service policies or similar undertakings of Seller) shall be enforceable by LGEUS’s customers and any subsequent owner or user of the Goods or Services or products produced from or containing the Goods and/or Services as well as by LGEUS. Such warranties shall survive LGEUS’s inspection, testing, acceptance and payment for such Goods and Services. As to each of the Goods, each of the Seller’s warranties begins on the date of delivery to LGEUS and continues until the last to occur of the following: (a) the expiration of all warranties made by LGEUS to its customers concerning LGEUS’s product incorporating the Goods; or (b) the expiration of the longest period of time which LGEUS’s customer may be required, by contract or law, to repair or replace the Goods or LGEUS’s product incorporating the Goods, if the Goods are defective or nonconforming to any warranties. The statute of limitations period applicable to any breach of warranty will be the longest statute of limitation period for breach of contract, products liability, or indemnity claims in any jurisdiction of the United States, or, in the case of any recall, the longest time period dictated by the U.S. federal, state or foreign government where the Goods are used. Approval by LGEUS of Seller’s design, drawings, specifications, samples, etc. does not waive or limit any warranty.\n",
      "9. Certain Remedies\n",
      "\n",
      "Seller shall be liable for all damages, including all consequential, incidental, third party and special damages incurred by LGEUS as a result of Seller's failure to meet or otherwise comply with the warranties contained herein. Without limiting Seller's liability hereunder, if the Goods or Services are defective in any way or do not conform to such warranties or with the other provisions of these terms and conditions or the Purchase Order, LGEUS, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies it may have, may revoke its acceptance of or may reject any or all of the Goods and Services. Upon such revocation or rejection, LGEUS may return, at Seller's expense, any or all of the Goods or require prompt correction or replacement of the Goods and Services at Seller's expense.\n",
      "10. Indemnification\n",

Seller shall obtain authorization from LGEUS before settlement is made of the claims, losses, liabilities, damages and expenses, suit or action if, the terms of such settlement could materially affect LGEUS.\n",
      "11. Limitation of Liability\n",
      "\n",
      "In no event will LGEUS or its subsidiaries or affiliates be liable for any lost revenues, lost profits, incidental, indirect, consequential, special or punitive damages.\n",
      "12. Insurance\n",

      "Seller shall obtain and maintain worker’s compensation (with a waiver of subrogation against LGEUS) and employer's liability insurance in amounts required under the laws of the state(s) in which the Goods and /or Services are to be performed; and comprehensive general liability and automobile liability insurance for bodily injury, death or loss of or damage to property of third persons in the minimum amount of $2,000,000 per occurrence which policy shall name LGEUS as an additional insured. Seller shall, upon request, promptly furnish to LGEUS certificates of insurance, as well as copies of any endorsements thereto evidencing LGEUS being added as an additional insured. The certificate shall also indicate that LGEUS shall be given thirty (30) days’ written notice of any cancellation, termination, non-renewal or material change in coverage. Such insurance shall be primary regarding any insurance LGEUS may have in force in connection with the Goods and Services contemplated under this Agreement.\n",
      "13. Force Majeure\n",
      "\n",
      "No liability hereunder shall result to either party from any failure or delay in payment, performance, non-performance, acceptance or non-acceptance with respect to the Goods or Services caused by circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party affected, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, fire, accident or disaster, or by reason of any law, regulation or other act of any governmental authority, including court orders, or labor problems; provided, however, that the affected party shall promptly give written notice to the other party whenever such failure or delay becomes reasonably foreseeable, and shall use its best efforts to overcome promptly the effects of such failure or delay. If Seller, by reason of a failure or delay excused under this paragraph, is unable to supply Goods or Services the same as or similar to the ones covered herein, in the quantities contracted for, Seller shall allocate its actual production among its internal needs and its customers in a fair and reasonable manner. If notwithstanding such efforts such failure or delay continues for a period of more than thirty (30) days, the other party may elect to terminate the Purchase Order. Quantities of Goods omitted due to any failure or delay excused under this paragraph shall, without liability, be deleted from the Purchase Order.\n",

Seller undertakes not to employ under age children to manufacture products or to perform any other related task and must abide by ILO standards with regard to freedom of association, the minimum age for admission to employment, and health and safety at work. Upon request, Seller must be able to prove that all of the Goods and Services provided to LGEUS comply with the aforementioned standards, and certify that they have procured the same commitments from their sub-contractors, manufacturers, service providers and traders.\n",

      "        Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n",
      "            Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.\n",
      "            Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 1 Western Ave, Apt 703, Boston, Massachusetts 02163. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.\n",
      "            Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.\n",
      "            Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n",
      "            Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.\n",
      "            Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.\n",
      "            Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n",
      "            Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\n",
      "            Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.\n",
      "            Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n",
      "            Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\n",
      "            Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.\n",
      "            Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.\n",
      "            Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.\n",
      "            Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\n",
      "            In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Suffolk County, Massachusetts, for such purpose\n",

      "20.7 Dispute Resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand GBP (UK £5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (4) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, INZITE may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from UK law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought, exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are applicable to your use of the INZITE Properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (“CIArb” ). As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the CIArb’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures” ).\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) You and INZITE must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR INZITE MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, INZITE will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (iv) INZITE also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (v) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (vi) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (vii) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (viii) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance , the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable law.\n",
      "\n",
      "(e) The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will control. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 15 of the Terms. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of the Terms, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by United Kingdom law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or INZITE may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the courts located in The United Kingdom. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the courts, in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.\n",

      "(f) With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor INZITE shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in the United Kingdom. By using the INZITE Properties in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration provision.\n",

      "\n",
      "2.7 Third Party Integrations. Air Computing may make available integrations with third party products and services for use in conjunction with the Amium Product (\"Third Party Integrations\").

Air Computing shall have no responsibility for any Third Party Integrations, including for their interoperability, security, functionality, operation, or integrity or for any use of Customer’s User Input or other data by Third Party Integrations. In order for the Amium Product to interoperate with such Third Party Integrations, Customer may be required to input credentials in order for the Amium Product to access and receive relevant information from such Third Party Integrations. Customer is solely responsible for complying with any relevant terms and conditions or usage restrictions applicable to such Third Party Integrations and maintaining appropriate accounts in good standing with the providers of such Third Party Integrations. Upon request from the provider of a Third Party Integration, at Air Computing’s election, Customer will provide confirmation of Air Computing’s authorization to access Customer’s accounts.

If Air Computing receives a Third Party Request with respect to User Input, Air Computing will, to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third Party Request, use reasonable efforts to: (a) notify Customer of receipt of such Third Party Request and ask the third party to contact Customer directly and (b) comply with Customer’s reasonable requests regarding Customer’s efforts to oppose such Third Party Request at Customer’s expense. Customer will first seek to obtain the information required to respond to such Third Party Request on its own, and will contact Air Computing only if Customer cannot reasonably obtain such information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Air Computing may respond to or make any disclosures in response to a Third Party Request required by law.\n",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer agrees that Air Computing may obtain and aggregate technical and other data about Customer’s use of the Amium Product that is non-personally identifiable with respect to Customer (\"Aggregated Anonymous Data\"), and Air Computing may use the Aggregated Anonymous Data to improve, support and operate the Amium Product and otherwise for any business purpose during and after the term of this Agreement.

Any Air Computing Technology, performance information relating to the Amium Product, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Air Computing without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Air Computing, the subcontractors referenced in Section 12.9), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 10 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 10. The Receiving Party’s confidentiality obligations shall not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.\n",

You acknowledge and agree that NNIL will automatically charge your credit card on record with NNIL for the then-current subscription period upon the commencement of any renewal period. You will provide NNIL with valid and updated credit card information and you authorize NNIL to charge such credit card for all purchased subscriptions and renewals.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may terminate your subscription to the Site and Service at any time and you will not be obligated to pay any additional fees for upcoming subscription renewal periods but any subscription fees you have paid in advance will not be refunded. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, the credit card attached to your account will automatically be charged or credited the new prorated amount for the current month. The new plan rate will apply from your next billing cycle i.e. from the next time we charge your card. For example, assume you are on the Basic plan at $49/mo and decide to upgrade to the company plan at $95/mo halfway through a billing cycle. At the point you upgrade, there will be an automatic charge to your credit card of the pro rata amount - in this case $23 which is half of the difference between $95 and $49. From the next billing date you will be charged at the new plan rate of $95/mo. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your Account. NNIL does not accept any liability for such loss.\n",

      "17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cucumbertown in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Cucumbertown agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CUCUMBERTOWN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n",
      "    Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 17(a), we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief or other provisional relief in aid of arbitration from a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.\n",
      "    Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Cucumbertown will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Cucumbertown.\n",
      "    Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Cucumbertown’s address for Notice is: Cucumbertown, Inc., 1979 Edgewood Drive, Palo Alto, CA, 94303. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cucumbertown may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Cucumbertown shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Cucumbertown shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Cucumbertown in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.\n",
      "    Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Cucumbertown will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Cucumbertown for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n",
      "    No Class Actions. YOU AND CUCUMBERTOWN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Cucumbertown agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n",
      "    Modifications. In the event that Cucumbertown makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Cucumbertown’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cucumbertown’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Cucumbertown shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.\n",
      "    Enforceability. If Subsection 17(f) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 18 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.\n",

      "No action arising out of this Terms of Service or your use of the Cucumbertown Service, regardless of form or the basis of the claim, may be brought by you more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen (or if multiple causes, from the date the first such cause arose).\n",

      "17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cucumbertown in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Cucumbertown agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CUCUMBERTOWN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n",
      "    Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 17(a), we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief or other provisional relief in aid of arbitration from a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.\n",
      "    Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Cucumbertown will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Cucumbertown.\n",
      "    Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Cucumbertown’s address for Notice is: Cucumbertown, Inc., 1979 Edgewood Drive, Palo Alto, CA, 94303. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cucumbertown may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Cucumbertown shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Cucumbertown shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Cucumbertown in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.\n",
      "    Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Cucumbertown will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Cucumbertown for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n",
      "    No Class Actions. YOU AND CUCUMBERTOWN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Cucumbertown agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n",
      "    Modifications. In the event that Cucumbertown makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Cucumbertown’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cucumbertown’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Cucumbertown shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.\n",
      "    Enforceability. If Subsection 17(f) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 18 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.\n",

      "        ii. Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms, or threatens to harm children.\n",

      "\n",
      "    a. Microsoft account or Skype account. You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners. To access Skype on certain platforms, you have the option of using a Skype account or a Microsoft account.\n",
      "        i. Creating an Account. You can create a Microsoft account or a Skype account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account or Skype account. In some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account or Skype account to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account or Skype account.\n",
      "        ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you. You must sign into the Xbox Services (defined in section 14(a)(i)) at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account or Skype account is being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656. To manage your Skype account, you must \"Sign In\" at www.skype.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "        iii. Kids and Accounts. By using the Services, you represent that you have either reached the age of \"majority\" where you live or have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help before you create a Microsoft account or Skype account. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor that creates a Microsoft account or Skype account, you accept these Terms on the minor’s behalf and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account, Skype account, or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.\n",
      "        iv. Closing Your Account.\n",
      "            1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account or Skype account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60 days just in case you change your mind. After that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) below for a detailed explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your Microsoft account. To cancel your Skype account please submit a support request to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618280.\n",
      "            2. If your Services are canceled or your Microsoft account or Skype account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Services stops immediately and your license to use the software related to the Services ends. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or Skype account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account or Skype account (unless we are required by law to keep it). You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to material or products you’ve acquired.\n",
      "    b. Work or School Accounts. You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. You further agree that your use of the services may be subject to the agreements that Microsoft has with you or your organization and these terms do not apply. If you use a work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.\n",
      "    c. Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and/or equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.\n",
      "    d. Service Notifications. When there’s something important to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications to the email associated with your Microsoft account or, for Skype notifications, your Skype account. If you gave us your phone number in connection with your Microsoft account or Skype account, then we may send Service notifications to you via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number. Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.\n",

      "9. Payment Terms. If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "    a. Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft or Skype account was registered. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network which masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.\n",
      "    b. Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website and for your Skype billing account by signing into your account at www.skype.com. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.\n",
      "    c. Billing. By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method that you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services that you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.\n",
      "    d. Recurring Payments. When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that you are authorizing recurring payment, and payments shall be made to Microsoft by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (in the case of Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (in the case of credit card or similar payments) (collectively, \"Electronic Payments\"). Subscription fees are generally billed or charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and to process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.\n",
      "    e. Automatic Renewal. Provided that automatic renewals are allowed in your state, you may choose for Services to automatically renew at the end of a fixed service period.  We will remind you by email before any Services renew for a new term, and notify you of any price changes in accordance with section 9(k).  Once we have reminded you that you elected to automatically renew the Services, we may automatically renew your Services at the end of the current service period and charge you the then current price for the renewal term, unless you have chosen to cancel the Services as described below. We will also remind you that we will bill your chosen payment method for the Services renewal, whether it was on file on the renewal date or provided later. We will also provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. You must cancel the Services before the renewal date to avoid being billed for the renewal.\n",
      "    f. Online Statement and Errors. Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website, where you can view and print your statement. For Skype accounts you can access your online statement by signing into your account at www.skype.com. This is the only billing statement that we provide. If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the charge. If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund. If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.\n",
      "    g. Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our help topic.\n",
      "    h. Canceling the Services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. You can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form. You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; or (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled.\n",
      "    i. Trial-Period Offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you must cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring new charges, unless we notify you otherwise. If you do not cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period, we may charge you for the Service(s).\n",
      "    j. Promotional Offers. From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) in the event that Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.\n",
      "    k. Price Changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.\n",
      "    l. Payments to You. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may also reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.\n",
      "    m. Gift Cards. Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions. Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype’s Help page.\n",

The Program is open to users who reside in the markets listed in the FAQ. Individuals can have no more than one Program account, even if an individual has multiple email addresses, and households are limited to six accounts. The Program is solely for your personal and noncommercial use.\n",
      "            2. Points. Except for donating your points to a nonprofit organization listed in the redemption center, you cannot transfer points. Points are not your personal property, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis. You cannot purchase points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of points or Rewards per person, per household, or over a set period (e.g., a day). You may redeem no more than 550,000 points per calendar year in the Program. Points earned in the Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other program offered by Microsoft or third parties. Unredeemed points expire if you do not earn or redeem any points for 90 days.\n",
      "            3. Rewards. You may redeem your points by visiting the redemption center or you may contribute points to a listed nonprofit organization. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be required to provide additional information, like your mailing address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem points for Rewards. Once you order a Reward, you cannot cancel it or return it for a refund of points. If you order a Reward that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons Microsoft determines in its sole discretion, we may substitute a Reward of comparable value or refund your points. Microsoft may update the Rewards offered in the redemption center or discontinue to offer specific Rewards. Some Rewards may have age eligibility requirements. You are responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Reward. Rewards will be emailed to the email address you provide when ordering your Reward, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards are not for resale.\n",
      "            4. Cancelling Your Participation in the Program. Your Program account will be cancelled if you do not log in at least once in a 180-day period. Additionally, Microsoft reserves the right to cancel the Program account of a specific user without cause and without providing a reason. Upon Program cancellation (by you or us) or if the Program is suspended, you will have 90 days to redeem your points; otherwise, those points will be forfeited. At the point of cancellation, your right to use the Program and accrue future points ends.\n",
      "            5. Other Conditions. Microsoft reserves the right to disqualify you; disable your access to the Program or your Rewards account; and/or withhold points, Rewards and charitable contributions, if Microsoft believes you are tampering with or abusing any aspect of the Program or may be engaging in activities that violate these Terms.\n",

The information in your account may not always be accurate or up-to-date and should be viewed by any health care provider as informational only. The HealthVault Service does not hold records for healthcare providers or other medical or case management purposes. For example, HealthVault records are not designated record sets as defined under U.S. regulations. If a healthcare provider decides to include any data made available from HealthVault in its records, it should store a copy in its own system. If there is a co-custodian of a record in your account (because one of you invited the other), you acknowledge that the co-custodian has full control over that record and may cancel your access to the record, manage other peoples' access to the record, and view the record's data including how and when the record is used. Microsoft does not support non-Microsoft credentials (such as Facebook and OpenID), so HealthVault customer support will not be able to help with sign-in issues for those. If you lose your sign-in credentials, or if the account where you got your credentials closes, you will not be able to recover your stored data. To help maintain continued access, we suggest you use more than one sign-in credential with your HealthVault account.

      "15. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or If a Business Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States. We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. \"We,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" includes Microsoft, Skype (see section 10) and Microsoft’s affiliates and, if you use Skype Pay by Mobile, your mobile phone carrier.\n",

If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A. (or to your mobile phone carrier at its principal place of business in the United States marked ATTN: Legal Department). Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.\n",
      "    c. Small Claims Court Option. Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A. if you meet the court’s requirements.\n",
      "    d. Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. To start an arbitration, submit the form available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.

If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.\n",

You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in section 15(b). If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.\n",

If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration.

      "\n",
      "2.     About the UpCounsel Service. \n",
      "The UpCounsel Service is a platform for collaboration and communication between legal professionals and those seeking legal assistance. The UpCounsel Service provides access to UpCounsel’s virtual community of professional Consultant Users; easy collaboration through UpCounsel’s communication management tools; document management and storage; and simple, secure payment and invoicing tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. UpCounsel Is Not A Law Firm. UpCounsel does not offer legal representation. UpCounsel does not offer any legal advice, legal opinions, recommendations, referrals, or counseling.

      "\n",
      "b. UpCounsel Is Not An Attorney Referral Service or Employment Agency. UpCounsel is not an attorney referral service or employment agency. UpCounsel does not select or endorse any individual Consultant User to service a Legal Client. While UpCounsel uses commercially reasonable efforts to confirm that registered Consultant Users are licensed attorneys, we do not make any warranty, guarantee, or representation as to the legal ability, competence, quality, or qualifications of any Consultant User. UpCounsel does not warrant or guarantee that Consultant Users are covered by professional liability insurance. UpCounsel encourages Legal Clients to research any Consultant User before accepting professional advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. UpCounsel does not vouch for any of its Users. UpCounsel simply provides a platform on which those seeking legal assistance may communicate and transact with legal professionals. UpCounsel does not endorse any of its Consultant Users and does not sanction statements that Consultant Users make on the platform. UpCounsel makes no representation concerning the qualifications of non-attorney legal service providers.\n",
      "\n",
      " d. UpCounsel Does Not Guarantee Results. From time to time, Legal Clients may submit reviews of Consultant Users; these reviews do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of any future legal matter. UpCounsel will have no responsibility or liability of any kind for any User-Generated Content or legal advice you encounter on or through the Website, and any use or reliance on User-Generated Content or legal advice is solely at your own risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "e. Use of UpCounsel Does Not Create An Attorney-Client Relationship With UpCounsel. UpCounsel does not offer legal advice or services. Any use of the UpCounsel Service is not intended to, and does not, create an attorney-client relationship. Any communication via UpCounsel may not be held confidential. UpCounsel is not liable for the actions or omissions of any Consultant User performing consulting services for you.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "3. User Responsibilities. You, and you alone, are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. Your security is your responsibility.\n",

      "\n",
      "b. Relationship with Consultant Users. Because we cannot guarantee the fitness of any of our Consultant Users for your specific needs, we encourage Legal Clients to research any Consultant User before accepting professional advice. Legal Clients may also request a written legal engagement agreement specifying the terms, scope, limitations, and conditions of the representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. No Reliance on User-Generated Content. User-Generated Content posted on the Website, such as blog posts, is provided for informational purposes only, with no assurance that the User-Generated Content is true, correct, or accurate. User-Generated Content is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts. You should not delay or forego seeking legal advice or disregard professional legal advice based on User-Generated Content. Delay in seeking such legal advice could result in waiver of any claims you may have, depending on the applicable statute(s) of limitation. User-Generated Content is not regulated by any state or national bar association.\n",
      "\n",
      "d. Compliance with Laws. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the authority to, and are of legal age in your jurisdiction to, bind yourself to this Agreement; (ii) your use of the Service will be solely for purposes that are permitted by this Agreement; (iii) your use of the Service will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party; and (iv) your use of the Service will comply with all local, state and federal laws, rules, and regulations, and with all other UpCounsel policies.\n",

      "vi. infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights\n",
      "vii. impersonates any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives; or\n",
      "viii. violates the privacy of any third party.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.     \tUsers Must Be Over Age 18. You represent that you are over the age of 18. UpCounsel does not target our Content to children or teenagers under 18, and we do not permit any Users under 18 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 18, we will terminate that User’s account immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "c.     \tNo Liability for User Interactions; UpCounsel May Monitor Interactions. Any liability, loss or damage that occurs as a result of any User interactions, including, without limitation, Job Postings, that you input or receive through your use of the Service is solely your responsibility. At our discretion, we, or technology we employ, may monitor and/or record your general interactions with the Service, though not the specifics of your legal interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "d.     \tRight to Terminate Accounts. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, determine whether or not any User conduct is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Use, or terminate or deny access to and use of the Service to any User for any reason, with or without prior notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.     \tUser-Generated Content. You own your content, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. We have the right to remove content if we need to.\n",
      "\n",
      "a.     \tResponsibility for User-Generated Content. You may create content, written or otherwise, while using the Service (“User-Generated Content”). You are solely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that content. Any liability, loss or damage that occurs as a result of the use of any User-Generated Content that you make available or access through your use of the Service is solely your responsibility. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.     \tRight to Post. You represent and warrant that you have the right to post all User-Generated Content you submit. Specifically, you warrant that you have fully complied with any third party licenses relating to User-Generated Content, and have taken all steps necessary to pass through to end users any required terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "c.     \tUpCounsel May Modify or Remove Content. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, determine whether or not any User-Generated Content appropriate and complies with these Terms of Use, or refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any UpCounsel policy or is in any way harmful, inappropriate, or objectionable. UpCounsel further reserves the right to make formatting and edits and change the manner any User-Generated Content is displayed on the Website.\n",
      "\n",
      "d.     \tOwnership of User-Generated Content. Except for Content that originates from UpCounsel, we do not claim ownership of any Content that is transmitted, stored, or processed in your account. You retain all ownership of, control of, and responsibility for User-Generated Content you post. You may control access to your User-Generated Content through settings in your user account.\n",
      "\n",
      "e.     \tLicense Grant. Solely to allow UpCounsel to use Content you upload to the Service reasonably without violating any rights you have in it, you grant us the following rights: by posting any Content via the Website, you expressly grant UpCounsel and our successors a worldwide, sublicenseable, fully-paid and royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, display, modify, adapt, distribute, and perform the Content in connection with UpCounsel’s business purpose. This license does not grant UpCounsel the right to sell User-Generated Content or otherwise distribute it outside of our Website. This license will terminate at the time when the Content is removed from the Website.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.     \tConsultant Users. Consultant Users are independent legal professionals who offer to perform consulting services for prospective Legal Clients. They are not employees of UpCounsel.\n",
      "\n",
      "a.     \tNo Attorney-Client Relationship through Website Use. Use of the UpCounsel Website may not form an attorney-client relationship with Consultant Users. Information posted or made available on or through the Website, including, without limitation, any responses to legal questions posted on the Website; information in UpCounsel’s Guides and Documents; information posted publicly on the Website; or information sent in an unsolicited message to a User is not intended as legal advice, is not confidential, and does not create an attorney-client relationship. It is considered User-Generated Content.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.     \tAttorney-Client Relationship through Service Use. An attorney-client relationship may be formed through the use of the Service between Users and Consultant Users only. Legal Clients may post Jobs through the Service. Consultant Users may submit Bids and negotiate details of these Jobs prior to acceptance. Upon acceptance, the scope of a Consultant User’s representation is strictly limited to the matter agreed upon in the Bid unless Legal Client and Consultant User subsequently formalize their arrangement via a signed engagement letter or other written agreement, in which case the most recent written agreement would take precedence over a previously accepted proposal. A Bid is not a substitute for an in-person or telephone consultation with an attorney licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely upon information contained in a Bid as legal advice. UpCounsel takes every reasonable effort to ensure the privacy of Bids and other personal messages on our Service, but it cannot guarantee confidentiality. Communications requiring confidentiality should take place outside the UpCounsel Service, such as via telephone.\n",
      "\n",
      "c.     \tUser Responsibilities. Consultant Users are solely responsible for ensuring that any information, solicitations, or advertisements they post or place on the Website, including without limitation User-Generated Content, and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Website or the Service, fully comply with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "d.     \tPayment of Consultant Users. Certain specific terms govern Consultant Users and payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "                   \ti. \tUpCounsel Is Not A Party To Contracts. Legal Clients may contract with Consultant Users through posting and acceptance of Jobs. Such contracts are solely between the Legal Client and the Consultant User. UpCounsel will not be a party to any contracts for Jobs submitted through our Service, unless posted by an UpCounsel officer. UpCounsel facilitates these contracts by supplying a platform for communication management and payment tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "                   \tii. \tAll Legal Fees Are Paid To Consultant Users. UpCounsel does not provide legal services and does not charge for legal services. Payments made to Consultant Users via UpCounsel’s billing platform are transferred directly to the Consultant User’s payment account, less any associated service and processing fees (e.g. credit card fees).\n",
      "\n",
      "                  \tiii. \tConsultant Users Shall Receive Payment Through The Service For All User Transactions. Consultant Users who receive Jobs through the Service shall receive payment through the service for all transactions related to that user, including subsequent transactions not necessarily related to the initial Job. If a Legal Client is either unwilling or unable to make payment via UpCounsel, Consultant User agrees to notify UpCounsel of any new payment arrangement.

The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.

For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is US$10,000.00 or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules.

The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.

      "\n",
      "b) The contract to purchase paid learning content in the form of digital flashcards is exclusively between “Brainyoo” and the user. This point shall also apply when the user has arrived at the “Brainyoo” shop via a link from a third-party provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) Insofar as these terms are concerned, “Brainyoo” refers to Brainyoo Mobile Learning GmbH and its service offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "d) “Brainyoo” sells to users worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "e) “Brainyoo” follows applicable law and is not subject to any other privately created codes of conduct or out-of-court complaint and redress procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "f) Contract language is German solely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Terms of Reference\n",
      "\n",
      "a) The user can purchase time-limited or unlimited rights to content in the form of digital flashcards (in the following content) from BrainYoo connected online shop or its affiliated partner companies. The service description of the content, i.e. in particular the life, contents, and subject matter of the learning content, is determined according to the specific description beside the product when ordering from the BrainYoo online shop, which is binding and final. Other public statements by the manufacturer or its agents or third-parties shall not constitute additional or changing specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) The effective use of digital flashcards requires that you install the BRAINYOO 2.0 and/or BRAINYOO 2.0 Mobile software and set up an account. The BRAINYOO 2.0 software can be downloaded and installed for free under a separate license agreement (http://www.brainyoo.com/legal/license-agreement/). The required account can be set up under a separate license agreement of terms and conditions (http://www.brainyoo.com/legal/gtc/) either free of charge or with additional features – as a Premium account – for a fee. Just like content, the Premium Account can be ordered later in accordance with the paragraph 4, see below. Any relevant legal relationships are governed separately and are not subject to this contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) With each order, BrainYoo uses its encryption software to encrypt every single digital flashcard with a BrainYoo license created for each individual user, which allows the learning content to be installed on a maximum of 2 desktop computers and 2 mobile devices in the Free Version or up to 3 desktop computers and 3 mobile versions in the Premium Version. The file is also linked with the personal user ID and, in case of time-limited rights of usage, limited by an expiration date. In this way, unauthorized installation in multiple locations or sharing of digital flashcard sets with an unauthorized third party is prevented; acts of infringement are ascribed to the particular user. The user shall refrain from any manipulation of the encryption or the link to the file with the identifying data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. How the Order Works\n",
      "\n",
      "a) The user goes to the website of “BrainYoo”, where he can see the detailed description by clicking on selected content. In some cases, it is possible that the details are buried through several levels of multiple clicks.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) The user can enter the desired number of units and place the product in the shopping cart by clicking the “Add to Shopping Cart” button.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) The shopping cart will then show all of the products that have been placed into the shopping cart. The user can then enter a different number to change the quantity or click the cross in the product line to remove the product from the cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "d) The user can then click various buttons to “Update” (e.g. after a change) the contents of the shopping cart, “Continue Shopping”, or “Proceed to Checkout”. “Continue Shopping” goes back to the shop (a) above, where additional products can be selected. “Proceed to Checkout” continues in the ordering process to the last step with the shopping cart. On the shopping cart display page, users should examine the goods and quantity being ordered and make any corrections by changing the number or deleting the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "e) Until the final legally binding order is placed, the user can abandon the ordering process at any time without placing the order by closing the browser window.\n",
      "\n",
      "f) If the user clicks “Proceed to Checkout”, he must log on to the shop with his Brainyoo account. If the user does not have an active account, he must create one at this point. In doing so, he must enter any data required to complete the contract and accept the account terms and the privacy policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the user can choose from several payment options offered by “Brainyoo” on the following page. Payment for the products is currently accepted through PayPal, credit card or prepayment. When paying with a credit card, the withdrawal from your bank account is made with the conclusion of your order.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the bottom of the page are a checkbox and a link “Shop Terms” and another link “Privacy Policy”; these links lead to either the “Brainyoo” terms or the privacy policy. By clicking on the checkboxes, the user acknowledges that he has read and agrees to the terms and conditions and the privacy policy. It is up to the user to save these statements by clicking the “Save” button on his hard drive and/or by clicking the “Print” button to print these documents immediately or at a later date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore the user can instruct BrainYoo to start the execution of the contract before expiry of the withdrawal period.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "g) By clicking the “Continue” button, the user is taken to the summary showing all of his data. He should check this data and, if necessary, correct any errors by clicking on the appropriate link.\n",
      "\n",
      "h) By clicking on “PlaceOrder to Pay“, the user submits his legally binding order according to the data shown in the general summary. At this point, the “Brainyoo” information is stored and verified.\n",
      "\n",
      "i) The user receives a confirmation as soon as the data is received on the “Brainyoo” server. “Brainyoo” will send a separate e-mail to the e-mail address specified by the user to declare acceptance of the order. With this e-mail, the user also receives the terms and conditions, the critical order details, legally required information, and the withdrawal policy in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "j) Once the user leaves the “Brainyoo” shop, the order is no longer available online. Order details and Terms and Conditions can be obtained again by individually requesting them from Brainyoo.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Conclusion of Contract\n",
      "\n",
      "The contract is concluded when “Brainyoo” confirms the online placed order via e-mail within two days or delivers the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Prices\n",
      "\n",
      "a) All prices are in Euros.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) The only prices that apply are the prices displayed to the user in the summary view prior to issuing the legally binding order (see 4g above). Moreover, the information contained in the web presentation, particularly prices, do not represent a binding offer and are subject to change. Errors on linked websites or differing prices on third-party websites are not legally binding upon the parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) The statutory VAT will be shown separately and is included in the stated price. There are no additional costs such as freight, delivery or postal charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Payment\n",
      "\n",
      "a) When placing the order, the user selects from among several methods of payment offered by “Brainyoo” (see paragraph 4f). Regardless of the chosen method of payment, payments are considered to be made only when “Brainyoo” has unlimited access to the full amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) The payment is due and payable immediately without deduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) The user is obliged to perform. d) The user shall not receive a right of retention with regard to remuneration due to the presence of defects of content, insofar as this is not in proportion to the defects and the estimated costs of rectification.\n",
      "\n",
      "f) Despite contractual implementation, if the method of payment selected by the user on behalf of “Brainyoo” is not feasible, in particular because it is not possible to debit from the user’s account due to lack of funds in the account or due to incorrect information, the user shall pay the settlement as well as any additional costs incurred by “Brainyoo” or a third party acting on the part of “Brainyoo”.\n",
      "\n",
      "g) “Brainyoo” is entitled to employ trustworthy third parties for the processing of payments for services provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. To this end, “Brainyoo” may assign claims against the user to third parties and transfer the personal data required for the handling of payments to said third parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In the case that a third party is employed for the payment process, the payment process shall only be considered completed in relation to “Brainyoo” when the payment is made to the third party as stipulated by the contract, so that the third party has full access to the payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Right of Withdrawal\n",
      "\n",
      "The user, if he is also the consumer, has a right of withdrawal in accordance with the legal provisions. Conditions, details, exercise, and consequences of withdrawal shall be explained in a separate statement in detail (http://brainyoo.de/legal/widerruf/).\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Performance by Brainyoo\n",
      "\n",
      "a) “Brainyoo” is entitled to employ third parties during the performance of the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) “Brainyoo” is entitled to perform only after receipt of payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) “Brainyoo” is entitled to deliver partial shipments when multiple products are ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "d) The performance of “Brainyoo” is completed by activating the user and enabling access to the flashcards ordered to the Brainyoo website over the Internet (“in the cloud”). Upon activation, BrainYoo grants the user the non-exclusive, territorially unlimited, and time-limited or unlimited access (according to the order) to use and reproduce the content on 2 desktop computers and 2 mobile devices in the Free Version or 3 desktop computers and 3 mobile devices in the Premium Version. Independently of this, the Brainyoo 2.0 software creates a copy of the flashcards on the user’s approved device during the first synchronization. Installation of the Brainyoo 2.0 software, setup of the account, and initiating the synchronization and creation of these copies is the sole responsibility of the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Content Protection\n",
      "\n",
      "The learning content to be acquired is legally protected, sometimes in accordance with the Trademark Act, the Design Act, or the Patents Act, and sometimes by international protection laws. Therefore, the learning content may only be used by the user within the timeframe allowed by the conditions of the order. Use beyond those conditions is unlawful and prohibited and can result in injunctive relief and damages of the rights holder against the user. In addition, violations of copyrights or other intellectual property rights regularly represent offenses that are introduced to the prosecution by the rights holder.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Reservation of Rights\n",
      "\n",
      "The granting of rights to the content is subject to the condition of complete fulfilment of Brainyoo from the order against the user of entitled claims to payment of fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Claims for Defects\n",
      "\n",
      "a) The damage to property and liability for legal defects shall be governed by the statutory provisions §§434 ff, 475ff of the German Civil Code permanent assignment of rights of use or §§536ff of the German Civil Code temporary assignment of rights of use\n",
      "\n",
      "b) Should complaints arise, these should be immediately submitted to the attention of “Brainyoo” at the address provided in section 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. No Implied Warranties\n",
      "\n",
      "Statements in connection with this agreement (e.g. specifications, figures on the website, the description on the website, etc.) contain no assumption of a guarantee in case of doubt. In case of doubt, only explicit statements on the part of BrainYoo are decisive on the assumption of a guarantee.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Privacy Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brainyoo” collects, processes, and uses personal data from the user for completion of the contract within the framework of the separately issued Statement of Privacy (http://brainyoo.de/legal/datenschutz/) and in accordance with legal provisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Entering Incorrect Data\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the unauthorized entry of personal data belonging to third parties or the incorrect input of personal data can lead to data processing by Brainyoo that is not allowed by the data privacy statute. The user shall not enter any false personal information or third-party information without authorization. By entering information, the user confirms that he is authorized to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Final Provisions\n",
      "\n",
      "a) The place of fulfilment is the headquarters of “Brainyoo”, Wiesbaden.\n",
      "\n",
      "b) The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising out of or in connection with this agreement is Wiesbaden, provided that the user is a merchant. “Brainyoo” is entitled to bring action or initiate other legal proceedings at the user’s general place of jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) If one or more of the aforementioned provisions of this agreement should be deemed invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.\n",

    "That's longer than I expected, but ok. So my sweet spot is going to be in that 2500+ word category.  What else can I use as a heuristic to distinguish contracts for a quick scrape? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an idea.  *contractey* words are going to be words that appear frequently in the contract dataset but don't appear frequently in english in general.  Peter Norvig has [word counts for a few hundred thousand common words](http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt), which I'll just download for now; they're a few years old (but then again, contract writing probably laggs writing in general).\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's define a word's contract-frequency number of times it appears in the contracts I have, and its language-frequency as the number of times it appears in Norvig's counts. Since there may be words in the contracts that don't appear in the counts on grounds of them being very rare, I'll assign them a language-frequency of the minimum of Norvig's list.  (Anything smaller poses an unacceptable risk of overweighting stuff like proper names.)  Then a word's score will be `log(contract-frequency/language-frequency)`, and anything with a score a standard deviation or so above average should be a *fairly decent* indicator of a ToS, I hope...\n",
